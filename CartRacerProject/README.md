# CSCI 5619: VR Kart Racing Game Project
A repository to be used for work on Jacob Nelson and Haining Lan's CSCI5619 class project

## What we have built
    *Simple Track
    *Virtual Steering
    *Item Collection: Loot Box(obtain item), Bananas(slow down the kart when collide), watermelon(accelerate), Ghost Hand(use go-go grasping to grab items)
    *Speed Control by a lever
    *Enemy kart that can interact


## How to play the game
    *Use the grabbing button of the controller to control the steering whell. Use the select butten to use the item.
    *Use the grabbing button to controll the lever, push the lever forward to accelerate, push backward to reverse
    *When you are using the ghost hand, stretch your hand while holding the select button.

## Difference between the proposal
    *Remove the Green Shell and replace it with the watermelon
    *Initially we need to grab the items from the box, but instead we just need to collide with the box to get the item.
    *We canâ€™t store 2 items.
